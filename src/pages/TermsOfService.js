          Last Updated: November 12, 2021 Welcome to the online store of Figma,
          Inc. (“Figma”) located at www.store.figma.com (the “Site”). Figma
          provides this Site as a service to our customers. Please read the
          following terms of service (“Terms”) as they govern your use of our
          Site and our services and content accessible via our Site. To make
          these Terms easier to read, the Site and such services and content are
          collectively called the “Services.” By using our Services, you agree
          to be bound by these Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by these
          Terms, do not use the Services. We may update the Terms at any time.
          If we do so, we’ll let you know either by posting the updated Terms on
          the Site or through other communications. It’s important that you
          review the Terms whenever we update them or you use the Services. If
          you continue to use the Services after we have posted updated Terms,
          you are agreeing to be bound by the updated Terms. If you don’t agree
          to be bound by the updated Terms, then you may not use the Services
          anymore. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or
          discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without
          notice, at our sole discretion.{" "}

        <h5>
          Please refer to our Privacy Policy and Shopify’s Privacy Policy for
          information on how we and Shopify, respectively, collect, use and
          disclose information from users. You acknowledge and agree that your
          use of the Services is subject to our Privacy Policy and Shopify’s
          Privacy Policy. Information submitted by users to the Site will be
          transmitted to and shared with third parties that may be located in
          other countries, in order to provide services to such users, including
          but not limited to transaction processing and fraud prevention.
        </h5>
        <h2>Payments</h2>
        <h5>
          When you make a purchase through our Services, you authorize us or our
          third-party payment processor to charge your payment method for any
          such purchases (plus any applicable taxes and other charges) that may
          be accrued by or in connection with your purchase. You are responsible
          for the timely payment of all fees and for providing a valid method of
          payment. All prices, fees and any applicable taxes and other charges
          are payable at checkout. When you initiate a purchase transaction via
          the Services, you will be asked to provide customary billing
          information such as your name, billing address, and credit card
          information. You may also need to provide additional information to
          verify your identity before completing your transaction. If you are
          completing the purchase using a third party payment processor, that
          processor’s terms and conditions apply to your payment transaction.
